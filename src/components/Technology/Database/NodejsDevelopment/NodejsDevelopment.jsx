                    An open-source server-side technology, Node.js is developed
                    based on Google's V8 engine. Node.js is the preferred choice
                    of developers for the development of web-based applications
                    due to its real-time capabilities and rapid development
                    speed. Its event-driven, asynchronous I/O method eliminates
                    the need for multiple threading, connects both front-end and
                    back-end and offers scalable, cross-platform ways to speed
                    up development.
